ChipAnalyser - Image-Processing for Machining Chip Analysis
===========================================================

# Overview
ChipAnalyser is an image-processing program designed to analyze machining chips from a series of images or a video file. It measures the following characteristics of the chip in each image:
- Tool-chip contact length
- Average peak thickness
- Average valley thickness
Measurement results are saved in a CSV file. Additionally, the program can generate graphical renderings to illustrate the measurement process.

# Usage
```shell
python3 ChipAnalyser [-S] -i INPUT_IMAGES -o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY [-s SCALE] [-b BATCH_SIZE] [-r]
```
`-S, --silent`: if this option is enabled, the program does not display progress bar

`-i INPUT_IMAGES`: path to the directory containing the images to be analyzed, or path to the video whose images are to be analyzed.

`-o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`: path to the directory where output files will be written

`-s SCALE`: length of a pixel in Âµm (1 by default).

`-b BATCH_SIZE`: size of the input image batches (10 by default).

`-r`: if this option is enabled, the program produces graphical renderings of the feature extractions, else, no rendering is done and the program simply extracts the features from the inputs.
